# PM - Project Management

Here are summaries of the two projects mentioned:

**Heritage Arboretum Development Project:**

This project aimed to develop the Heritage Arboretum, divided into three phases: planning, stakeholder engagement, and execution. Using Agile methodologies, the team secured arboretum certification, built necessary infrastructure, and organized community educational programs.
Key activities included creating an MVP, engaging stakeholders, managing risks, and developing educational outreach. The project focused on continuous community feedback and agile principles to guide the development.

**Business Move - Office Relocation to Downtown Kitchener:**

This project focused on relocating a business to downtown Kitchener, with a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), resource allocation, and task scheduling using Microsoft Project. The move involved planning, packing, and a move-in date set for September 9, 2024.
The project ensured balanced resource allocation and task tracking to avoid overloading team members, with key constraints like the fixed move-in date to keep everything on track.


Both projects highlight efficient planning, stakeholder management, and the use of Agile or structured methodologies.
